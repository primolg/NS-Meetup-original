Data visaluaization Public Transit Analysis in ArcGIS: http://esri.github.io/public-transit-tools/;
icons: https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-helmet-safety?s=solid;

to-do list & bugs:
    -search trip by location instead of station
    -handicap accessability icon 
    -swap "from" and "to" values 
    -time change bug in trip lookup form. I have a feeling it might be on the api's end, but needs looking into.
    -when meetup has multiple words it gets spaced out into the lng and lat spots, needs fixing.
    -single-trip: link button fails to render when following these steps: open a single trip and copy it's link, then return to trips, and open the same single trip.
