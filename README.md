# NS-Meetup

This is an application I'm developing to help people coordinate meetups using dutch public transit. 
As of right now I'm building the trip planner, maintenence checker, and other basic public transit app functionality, which will be followed by a system to share trips and set meeting points based on businesses, sites, etc. near the given trip destination.
